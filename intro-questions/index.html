                <p>Name: Elyse Tang </p>
                <p>Major: Computer Science, Communication Design</p>
                <p>Year: Sophomore</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>What prompt me to take this class? I took this class because I am interested in web design and development.</p></li>
            <li><p>Previous experience: I learned about HTMl/CSS/JS in high school.</p></li>
            <li><p>One thing I hope to learn in this class: I would love to learn how to host a website with database. If this is not within the scope of this class, then I want to learn how to make my website look asethetic and professional.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper:</p>
                <p>Designing for screen will involve a lot of programming knowledge whereas designing for paper is mostly illustration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design: <a href="https://www.notion.so/product"> Notion </a></p>
                <p>Notion's product introduction page is well-designed because it includes a balanced amount of images and texts which makes it comfortable for users to read through. 
                    The website also utilizes tables and ordered lists to organize information neatly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication: <a href="//www.apple.com/"> Apple </a></p>
                <p>I think Apple's website communicates information very effectively because the typographical hierarchy indicates the level of emphasis on each piece of information very clearly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide a link to a website you think works well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> YouTube </a></p>
                <p>I think YouTube's website works well because the layout is very clean. There are also many useful features. For example, when the user hovers on a thumbnail, 
                    there is a preview of that video, which I think is convenient for the user to get a sense of what the video is aboue.</p>
