        <p>
            <br>God damn, I didn't see it
            <br>When you lived here all your life, I didn't mean it
            <br>And I swear, I know I greeted
            <br>But it's hard sometimes to breathe in on the ceiling
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Dream of palaces and countrysides
            <br>All I want, want, want, want
            <br>Is to wake up with the morning light, laughing all alone
            <br>Break away from all the city lights, hiding in the dark
            <br>'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong, yeah, I don't belong
        </p>
        <p class="belong">
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong (And I don't belong where I don't belong)
            <br>Yeah, yeah
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>I'm blessed
            <br>I'll believe it when they tell me I'm here for a reason
            <br>Hold on, another season
            <br>Couple minutes back and forth, then we'll be leaving
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>To our palaces and countrysides
            <br>All I want, want, want, want
            <br>Is to wake up with the morning light, laughing all alone
            <br>Break away from all the city lights, hiding in the dark
            <br>'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong, yeah, I don't belong
        </p>
        <p class="belong">
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong (And I don't belong where I don't belong)
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>No, no, It's just a feeling, just a feeling
            <br>It's just a feeling, just a feeling
            <br>It's just a feeling, just a feeling
            <br>It's just a feeling, just a feeling
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Dream of palaces and countrysides
            <br>All I want, want, want, want
            <br>Is to wake up with the morning light, laughing all alone
            <br>Break away from all the city lights, hiding in the dark
            <br>'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong, yeah, I don't belong

            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong
            <br>No, I don't belong (And I don't belong where I don't belong) yeah
